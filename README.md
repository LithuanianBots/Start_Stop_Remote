# Start_Stop_Remote

Start_Stop_Remote is a compact infrared remote designed for use with the MINI SUMO kit mainboard. It provides a small, robust controller for starting and stopping matches and is built with readily-available components to make assembly and sourcing easy.

Key features
- Remote uses IR SMD LEDs for a low-profile, reliable IR transmitter.
- Remote has additional IR LED footprints for standard 5 mm LEDs if you prefer through-hole components.
- PCB size: 80 mm x 40 mm — compact and easy to fit in a small enclosure.
- All free ATmega328 pins are routed to accessible solder pads so you can expand or repurpose the board.
- Most parts come from the LCSC basic parts library to simplify procurement.
